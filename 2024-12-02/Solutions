Problem 1
175. Combine Two Tables
Select P.firstName, P.lastName, A.city, A.state
From Person P
Left Join [Address] A
on A.personId = P.personId;
--Left Join to include all Persons 

Problem 2
181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
Select E.name as Employee
From Employee E
Left Join Employee E1
on E1.Id = E.managerId 
Where E.Salary > E1.Salary and E.managerId is not null;

Problem 3
184. Department Highest Salary
Select D.name as Department
, E.name as Employee
, E.Salary
From Employee E
Join Department D
On E.departmentId = D.id
Where Salary = (Select top(1)E1.Salary From Employee E1 where E1.departmentId = D.id 
                Order by E1.Salary desc);

Problem 4
1045. Customers Who Bought All Products
Select C.Customer_id
From Customer C
Join Product P
On P.product_key = C.product_key
Group by C.Customer_id
Having (Select Count(Distinct(C1.product_key)) as numb1
        From Customer C1
        Where C.Customer_id = C1.Customer_id)
        = (Select Count(product_key) as numb2
        From Product);

Problem 5
601. Human Traffic of Stadium
First Try Does not correctly identify 3 + consecutive records
Select S.id
, S.visit_date
, S.people
From Stadium S
Left Join Stadium S2
on S2.id = S.id+1
Left Join Stadium S3
on S3.id = S2.id+1
Where S.people >= 100
and (S2.people >=100 or S2.people is null)
and (S3.people >=100 or S3.people is null);

A different approach

Declare @@numofrow int
Set @@numofrow = (Select Count(id) From Stadium);
With priordate as (Select (SP.id+1) as id, SP.visit_date as visit_date, SP.people as people 
From Stadium SP),
priordate2 as (Select (SP.id+2) as id, SP.visit_date as visit_date, SP.people as people 
From Stadium SP),
nextdate as (Select (SN.id-1) as id, SN.visit_date as visit_date, SN.people as people 
From Stadium SN),
nextdate2 as (Select (SN.id-2) as id, SN.visit_date as visit_date, SN.people as people 
From Stadium SN)
Select S.id, S.visit_date, S.people
From Stadium S
Left Join priordate PD
On PD.id = S.id
Left Join nextdate ND
On ND.id = S.id
Left Join priordate2 PD2
On PD2.id = S.id
Left Join nextdate2 ND2
On ND2.id = S.id
Where (S.people >= 100
and (PD.people >= 100 or S.id = 1)
and (ND.people >= 100 or S.id = @@numofrow))
or (S.people >= 100
and (PD.people >= 100 or S.id = 1)
and (PD2.people >= 100 or S.id = 1))
or (S.people >= 100
and (ND.people >= 100 or S.id = @@numofrow)
and (ND2.people >= 100 or S.id = @@numofrow));
