Problem 1

Problem 2

Select C.Name As Customers
From Customers As C
Full Join Orders As O
On O.CustomerId = C.id
Where O.Id is null;
Problem 3

Solution gets runtime error after submission I realize that it only works if players have only been 2 times looking into other ways to compare the dates
Select cast((cast(Count(*) as decimal(4,2))/cast((Select Count(Distinct(player_ID)) From activity) as decimal(4,2))) as decimal(4,2)) as fraction
from (Select DATEDIFF(day, (Select top(1)event_date from Activity Where Player_id = A.Player_id Order by event_date),
    (Select top(1)event_date From Activity  Where Player_id = A.Player_id Order by event_date desc)) as diff
From Activity as A
Group by A.player_id
Having DATEDIFF(day, (Select top(1)event_date from Activity Where Player_id = A.Player_id Order by event_date),
    (Select top(1)event_date From Activity Where Player_id = A.Player_id Order by event_date desc))  = 1) Diff;
